# Ubuntu Setup Notes
The target deployment environment for this project is Ubuntu Linux
(e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04).

These notes document assumptions and considerations for Ubuntu-based systems.

# Assumptions
- A modern Ubuntu LTS release
- Conda (Miniconda, Anaconda, or Miniforge) installed
- Python environments managed via Conda

# Notes
- System-level dependencies are handled outside this repo.
- No Ubuntu-specific commands are required for the assessment module at this stage.
- Additional setup steps may be added once GPU access and lab infrastructure are finalized.
