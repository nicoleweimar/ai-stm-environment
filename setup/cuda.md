# CUDA / GPU Notes 

CUDA is not required in the current stage of this project. Both the asseesment module and environment verification scripts are able to run on CPU-only systems. 

## GPU Support
GPU acceleration will be enabled once target hardware is confirmed, NVIDIA driver and CUDA versions specified, and a deep learning framework is selected. 

After these steps, CUDA specific installation and version constraints will be documented here. The verification script, `verify/` reports CUDA availability.
